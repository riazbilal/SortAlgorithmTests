Assignment 4 

All my sorting algorithms I implemented are working properly. This includes my extra credit sort RiazSort. However, when implementing assig4.java  I did compute the best and worst overall and for each algorithm. When I tested my sorting algorithms initialized with random values, my computer was taking an unreasonably amount of time to sort any array size larger than 200,000.
